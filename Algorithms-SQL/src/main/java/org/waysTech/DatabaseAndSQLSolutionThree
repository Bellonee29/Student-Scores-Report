    In SQL, JOIN clauses are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

    ## A RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows from the right table ("right side" of the join), and the matching rows from the left table.
    If there are no matches, the result set will contain NULL values for the left side.

    ## A LEFT JOIN returns all the rows from the left table ("left side" of the join), and the matching rows from the right table.
     If there are no matches, the result set will contain NULL values for the right side.
